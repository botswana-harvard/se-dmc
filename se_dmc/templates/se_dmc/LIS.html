            <h1>Laboratory Information Management System</h1>
            <p>BHP's current LIMS system was developed in-house in 2003 and hosted on an HP SERVER.<br/>
              <br/><b>The main reason for LIMS was:</b><br/>
                •to allow for BHHRL processes samples from various research projects
                and protocols conducted at BHP. This means the entire sampling life cycle of a specimen is
              processed and managed by the Laboratory using the LIMS. </p>
            <p><b>The life cycle of a sample:</b><br/>
              •Clinic/Project makes an analysis self for a sample from research project participant.<br/>
              •A sample is received at the lab which is a process called sample reception.<br/>
              •A plan is made for the sample by the lab to schedule the required analysis/test to be conducted and also determine if part of that same is to be stored or not.<br/>
              •The sample is then sent for testing and results are generated and fed back to the LIMS. This process is called resulting<br/>
              •If there are changes processing the sample,results are either reject/retracted and another aet of analysis is requested as necessary.
              If the results meet testing requirements and do not present any challenges they are verified by the LAB Manager to indicate that the results
              are correct and accurate and can be released. This process is called results verification.<br/>
              •The results are released upon approval and published,which involves remitting the results back to the originating clinic/study.<br/>
