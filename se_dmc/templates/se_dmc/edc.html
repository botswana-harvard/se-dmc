              <h3>What is an EDC System?</h3>
              <hr>
          <p>An electronic data capture (EDC) system is a computerized system
             designed for the collection of clinical data in electronic format
             for use mainly in human clinical trials.[1] EDC replaces the traditional
             paper-based data collection methodology to streamline data collection
             and expedite the time to market for drugs and medical devices. EDC
             solutions are widely adopted by pharmaceutical companies and contract
             research organizations (CRO).<br/><br/>

            
            <h3>Features Of Our EDCs</h3>
              <hr>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Robust</b> - our EDCs offer high performance as well the ability to detect invalid or altered records even when under extreme load with zero downtime</li>
                  <li><b>Graphical User Interface</b> - our EDCs are web-based giving users the flexibility to use any device they wish with out compromising security </li>
                  <li><b>Secure Data Storage</b> - sensitive data will always be encrypted in the database to avoid leaking sensitive information to the public and other users</li>
                  <li><b>Authorization</b> - limit access to specific users through use of permissions (e.g. some users will be able to see specific records while others cannot)</li>
                  <li><b>Authentication</b> - only registered users can login </li>
                  <li><b>Audit Trailing</b> - ability to track activities of everyone who is logged in the system </li>
                  <li> <b>Data Validation</b>  - our EDCs check to ensure that (only) the permitted sequencing of steps and events is enforced - if necessary.</li>
                  <li><b>Authentication</b> Authority checks to ensure that only authorized users can use the system (e.g. electronically generate and sign documents), and access the operating system, computer or peripherals.</li>
                  <li><b>We offer training & support</b> - we offer training to new users and support to users if they face any challenges </li>
                  <li><b>Well documented</b> - Our system come with the documentation for new users</li>
              </ul>
