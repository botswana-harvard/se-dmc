            <h1>Microbiome Study</h1>
            <p>An observational study investigating evolution of gut microbiome among HIV‐exposed but uninfected(HEU)infants and gut microbiome association with immune system
              development, comparing microbiome and immunesystem evolution between HEU infants and HIV‐unexposed uninfected(HUU) infants.</p>
            <b>The primary objectives of this study were to investigate differences in:</b><br/>
            •gut microbiome between HEU(HIV-exposed but uninfected) and HUU(HIV-unexposed and uninfected) infants in the first year of life, comparing gut microbiome at birth, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of life.<br/>
            •maternal microbiome at delivery from vaginal, rectal, skin and breast milk compared between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women.<br/>
            •the immune system of HEU infants, comparing this with the evolution of HEU gut microbiome to identify aspects of the gut microbiome development that are
            correlated with immune system development<br/><br/>

            <b>Uses of the system:</b><br/>
            •Record name of mother and child as well as age and statuses<br/>
            •Show a representation of maternal Study Visit and Laboratory Scheduled Activities<br/>
            •Show a representation of Interim Study Visits at 1,3,6,9 and 12 months of life<br/>
            •show a representation of Comparison of infant Mortality by HIV-Exposure Status<br/>
            •Abstract information from the maternal antenatal record or infant’s health booklet including date
            of birth, birth weight, birth length, birth head circumference,birth immunizations,medications given at birth,including HIV prophylaxis<br/>
            •Record Schedule of visits, Missed visits and sick visits
